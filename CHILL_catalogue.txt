---BASIC---
-----------
>   Compare files: compares two .txt files and highlight the differences, line by line.
>   Clean spaces: replace all the white spaces and special spaces (e.g. tabs) with a single white space.
>   Check series: check if any element is missing from a numeric series in a column type file.

---------
---PCS---
---------
>   NPC conversion suite: convert a .npc file produced by NUMBAT into a .pcs file with the option to delete a subset of unwanted atoms.
>   Randomization: delete a random % of PCS from a .pcs file. merge with get subset
>   Range deletion: delete all values in a selected range for a numeric column of a .pcs file.
>   Mapping: map a .pcs 'map' file on a .pcs 'key' file based on assignments (residue number - atom pair)
>   Get subset: extract from a .pcs file a subset of pcs based on a specified integer value or percentage.
>   Add module: follow-up of the mapping function, adds a specified dArmRP module from a 'map' to a 'file'
>   Increase mapped: TBA
