-----------
---BASIC---
-----------
>   Compare files: compares two .txt files and highlight the differences, line by line.
>   Clean spaces: replace all the white spaces and special spaces (e.g. tabs) with a single white space.
>   Check series: check if any element is missing from a numeric series in a column type file.

---------
---PCS---
---------
>   NPC conversion suite: convert a .npc file produced by NUMBAT into a .pcs file with the option to delete a subset of unwanted atoms.
>   Randomization: delete a random % of PCS from a .pcs file. merge with get subset
>   Range deletion: delete all values in a selected range for a numeric column of a .pcs file.
>   Mapping: map a .pcs 'map' file on a .pcs 'key' file based on assignments (residue number - atom pair)
>   Get subset: extract from a .pcs file a subset of pcs based on a specified integer value or percentage.
>   Add module: follow-up of the mapping function, adds a specified dArmRP module from a 'map' to a 'key' file
>   Increase mapped: follow-up of the mapping function, adds a specified amount of pcs from a 'map' to a 'mapped' file respecting the original mapping.

-----------
---CYANA---
-----------
>   OVW Analyze overview: quickly list target function, RMSD and number of violations of cyana overview files.
>   OVW Analyze violations: create a .pml PyMOL macro to highlight violating residues in a variety of ways.
>   OVW Analyze methyls violations: analyze how many violations are due to methyl atoms.
>   CYANA Batch iteration: assign a specified incremental value to each run in a batch file in order to obtain unique log and overview files.
>   CYANA Test input: quickly creates a .cya macro to check if the input of a cyana batch run is correct.
>   UPL Side chains manager: manage the upl involving side chains with three different possible functions.
>   UPL Methyl protons to carbon: TBA

---------
---PDB---
---------
>   Average structures: average the x, y and z coordinates of each atom for multiple .pdb files.
>   Convert nomenclature: TBA
>   Model variation: TBA

>   Journal club: keywords search in a large database of scientific journals.
>   Journal club special: keywords search for journals without a volume/issue architecture through PubMed.
