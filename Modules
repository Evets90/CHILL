Modules are pre-made sharable code packages that are used to implement default functions faster.
CHILL will not run unless you download the modules that it uses, visible after the "import" keyword.


Modules needed to run CHILL:
-pandas
-tkinter
-os
-pillow
-pathlib
-bs4
-requests
-re

How to install them:
0) Have python 3 already installed.
1) Open a terminal
2) Make sure that pip (the "downloading software") is updated by typing:
pip3 install --upgrade pip
3) For every module type:
pip3 install --user MODULENAME
(replace MODULENAME with the name of the module)

Example for pandas:
pip3 install --user pandas
